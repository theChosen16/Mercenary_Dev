## Introduction

### Purpose
This document provides a structured approach for responding to disasters that affect the availability of Mercenary's backend services.

### Scope
This plan covers the recovery of:
- Application servers
- Databases
- Caching layers
- File storage
- Configuration management

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

| Service | RTO | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Core API | 2 hours | Critical business functions |
| Database | 1 hour | With latest backup |
| Background Jobs | 4 hours | Can queue during recovery |
| Internal Tools | 8 hours | Non-customer facing |

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

| Data Type | RPO | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| User Data | 5 minutes | Transaction logs |
| Media Files | 1 hour | S3 versioning |
| Application Logs | 15 minutes | Centralized logging |
| System Metrics | 1 minute | Monitoring systems |

| Incremental | Every 15 minutes | 7 days | S3 |
| Transaction Logs | Continuous | 7 days | S3 |

### File Backups

## Recovery Procedures

### Full System Recovery

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Determine scope of disaster
   - Activate recovery team
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Launch replacement instances
   - Configure networking
   - Restore security groups

3. **Database Recovery**
   - Restore most recent backup
   - Apply transaction logs
   - Verify data consistency

4. **Application Deployment**
   - Deploy application code
   - Apply configurations
   - Verify service health

5. **Data Synchronization**
   - Sync user uploads
   - Rebuild caches
   - Verify data integrity

### Partial Recovery

1. **Database Point-in-Time Recovery**
   ```sql
   -- Example for PostgreSQL
   PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD pg_restore \
     --host=$DB_HOST \
     --username=$DB_USER \
     --dbname=$DB_NAME \
     --clean \
     --if-exists \
     --no-owner \
     --no-privileges \
     --verbose \
     latest_backup.dump
   ```

2. **File System Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Restore from S3
   aws s3 sync s3://backup-bucket/mercenary/uploads/ /app/uploads/
   
   # Set proper permissions
   chown -R app:app /app/uploads
   chmod -R 750 /app/uploads
   ```

### Disaster-Specific Procedures
