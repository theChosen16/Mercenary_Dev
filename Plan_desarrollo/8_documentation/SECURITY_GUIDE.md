## Authentication

### Password Policies

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Require mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Maximum password age: 90 days
- Password history: Last 5 passwords remembered
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Required for all administrative access
- Recommended for all users
- Support for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Backup codes provided during MFA setup

### Session Management

- Secure, HTTP-only cookies for session tokens
- Session timeout: 24 hours of inactivity
- Token rotation on privilege level change
- Secure flag set on all cookies
- SameSite attribute set to 'Lax'

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Predefined roles with least privilege:
  - Super Admin: Full system access
  - Admin: Administrative functions
  - User: Standard user access
  - Guest: Limited read-only access

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

- Fine-grained permissions based on:
  - User attributes
  - Resource attributes
  - Environment conditions
  - Action being performed

### API Authorization

- Validate all API requests
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Rate limiting based on user/role
- Input validation on all endpoints

## Data Protection

### Encryption

#### Data at Rest

- Full disk encryption on all servers
- Database encryption
- Encrypted backups
- Key management using AWS KMS/HashiCorp Vault

#### Data in Transit

- TLS 1.2+ required
- HSTS header enabled
- Certificate transparency
- OCSP stapling

### Data Masking

- Mask sensitive data in logs
- Redact PII in API responses based on permissions
- Tokenize sensitive data where possible

### Data Retention

- User data: Retained until account deletion + 30 days
- Logs: 90 days
- Backups: 1 year
- Audit logs: 7 years

## API Security

### Input Validation

- Validate all input data
- Use strong typing
- Sanitize user input
- Implement allow lists over block lists

### Output Encoding

- Encode all output to prevent XSS
- Use framework's built-in templating engines
- Set proper Content-Type headers

### Rate Limiting

- 1000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- 100 requests/hour for unauthenticated users
- Stricter limits for sensitive endpoints
- IP-based rate limiting for public endpoints

## Dependency Security

### Dependency Management

- Use package managers with lock files
- Pin all dependencies to specific versions
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use Dependabot for automated updates

### Vulnerability Scanning

- Snyk for dependency scanning
- OWASP Dependency-Check
- GitHub Security Alerts
- Regular security audits

### Supply Chain Security

- Verify package signatures
- Use private package repositories
- Audit third-party dependencies
- Monitor for compromised packages

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security

- VPC with private subnets
- Security groups with least privilege
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection

### Server Hardening

- Disable root login
- Use SSH key-based authentication
- Regular security updates
- File integrity monitoring

### Container Security

- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Resource limits

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Logging

- Authentication attempts
- Authorization failures
- Sensitive operations
- Configuration changes

### Log Management

- Centralized logging
- Structured log format
- Log rotation and retention
- Access controls on logs

### Anomaly Detection

- Unusual login patterns
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Unauthorized access patterns
- Resource usage anomalies

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

| Severity | Response Time | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Critical | 15 minutes | Data breach, system compromise |
| High | 1 hour | Unauthorized access attempt |
| Medium | 4 hours | Security misconfiguration |
| Low | 24 hours | Non-sensitive information disclosure |

### Response Process

1. **Identification**: Detect and confirm incident
2. **Containment**: Limit the scope of the incident
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems and data
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve

### Communication Plan
